# Personal-Website-Project

My name is Cole Whitehurst and I am an inspiring fullstack developer.
This is a project I am currently developing while apart of the Fullstack Academy Development Bootcamp.
My goal is to display the many concepts I have been learning and use this project to heighten my coding skills.
Upon completion, this site will have a brief overview of myself (Home), detailed info about my skills and interest (About), and a collection of all my other projects (Portfolio).
